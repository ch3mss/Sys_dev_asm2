## Notes App - CI Pipeline

- **Full Name/Names**: **PHU NGHIA NGUYEN**
- **Student ID/IDs**: **s3924506**

## 1. Project Overview and Problem Analysis

### 1.1 Application Architecture

The Notes application is a full-stack web application built with:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for data persistence
- **Frontend**: EJS templating engine for server-side rendering
- **Features**: Create, read, and delete notes functionality

### 1.2 Development Challenges

Modern software development faces critical challenges that this CI/CD pipeline addresses:

- **Manual Testing Inefficiency**: Time-consuming manual testing processes
- **Code Quality Inconsistency**: Lack of standardized coding practices
- **Integration Issues**: Components failing when integrated together
- **Deployment Reliability**: Manual deployment leading to production errors

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### 2.1 Pipeline Architecture

The GitHub Actions pipeline consists of 5 automated stages:

1. **Static Code Analysis (Lint)**: ESLint enforces coding standards
2. **Unit Testing**: Jest tests individual components with coverage reporting
3. **Integration Testing**: Tests database interactions with MongoDB
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright tests complete user workflows
5. **Build Artifacts**: Creates deployment packages (main branch only)

### 2.2 Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master, develop, "feature/*"]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Static Code Analysis (Lint)
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run test:lint
```

## 3. Testing Strategy and Implementation

### 3.1 Multi-Level Testing Approach

**Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated testing of individual functions

- **Tool**: Jest testing framework
- **Coverage**: Business logic, data models, utility functions
- **Execution**: `npm run test:unit`
- **Output**: Code coverage reports uploaded as artifacts

**Integration Tests**: Database and API endpoint testing

- **Environment**: MongoDB service container
- **Scope**: CRUD operations, route handlers, middleware
- **Execution**: `npm run test:integration`

**End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow validation

- **Tool**: Playwright with multiple browser engines
- **Coverage**: UI interactions, form submissions, data persistence
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

### 3.2 Quality Gates and Branch Protection

**Automated Quality Checks**:

- All tests must pass before merge
- Code coverage threshold maintained
- No direct commits to main branch
- Pull request reviews required

**Branch Strategy**:

- `main`: Production-ready code only
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `develop`: Integration testing branch

## 4. Pipeline Execution and Monitoring

### 4.1 Automated Triggers

The pipeline automatically executes on:

- Push to any tracked branch (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`)
- Pull request creation or updates to main/master
- Manual workflow dispatch from Actions tab

### 4.2 Artifact Generation and Deployment

**Build Process** (Main Branch Only):

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  name: Build Artifact
  needs: [lint, unit-test, integration-test, e2e-test]
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - name: Create deployment package
      run: |
        mkdir -p dist
        cp -r src dist/
        cp package*.json dist/
        tar -czf notes-app-${{ github.sha }}.tar.gz dist/
    - name: Upload Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: notes-app-${{ github.sha }}
        path: notes-app-${{ github.sha }}.tar.gz
```

## 5. Results and Benefits

### 5.1 Pipeline Performance

**Test Execution Times**:

- Linting: ~30 seconds
- Unit Tests: ~45 seconds
- Integration Tests: ~60 seconds
